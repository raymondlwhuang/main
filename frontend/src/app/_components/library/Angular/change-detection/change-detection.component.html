    <p>Angular detects changes fired every time by default, to improved page performance we could use change detection strategy: OnPush.</p>
    <p>But with this strategy, we needed to remember that the template of the component will only be checked in 2 cases</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one of the inputs of the component changed (to be more accurate, when the <em>reference</em> of one of the inputs changes);</li>
        <li>an event handler of the component was triggered.</li>
    </ul>

<div *ngFor="let image of imagesList; index as idx">
    <app-show-case *ngIf="idx==0" [inputHolder]="inputHolder"></app-show-case>
